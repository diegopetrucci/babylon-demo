# babylon-demo
Babylon demo project in SwiftUI &amp; Combine

### Known bugs and TODO's
* Add pagination
* Marking a photo as favourite does not make it appear at the top in the photos list
* network call should be prioritized/paginated/cancelled: loading data of a photo down the list takes a while
